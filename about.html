        <h2>The Thrill of Real Talk</h2>
        <p>I’m drawn to good conversation the way others are drawn to adrenaline. Not small talk — real talk. The kind where someone disagrees with you, challenges your beliefs, and leaves you thinking, <em>“I never saw it that way.”</em></p>
        <p>That’s what defines me as a person.</p>

        <h2>Why I Question Everything</h2>
        <p>I believe that there are no beliefs that aren't worth challenging. We used to believe the Earth was the center of the solar system. That smoking was healthy. That someone’s inherent worth could be measured by gender or race.</p>
        <p>Those ideas didn’t collapse on their own — they were questioned, debated, and pushed until something closer to truth emerged.</p>

        <h2>It Wasn’t Arguing — It Was Curiosity</h2>
        <p>When I was younger, people assumed I just liked arguing. I challenged my parents, my coaches, my friends — not out of disrespect, but because I had this compulsion to understand. I wasn’t a great communicator back then. I didn’t know how to hold space for someone else’s view while wrestling with my own.</p>
        <p>Over time, I’ve learned that real communication is 90% listening and only 10% replying.</p>

        <h2>The Noise and the Signal</h2>
        <p>We live in a world where it’s never been easier to share your opinion — overwhelming, right? How do I filter out misinformation and unnecessary noise without closing my mind?</p>
        <p>I don’t have all the answers. But I try to stay curious, listen carefully, and avoid jumping to conclusions. Curiosity isn’t just a trait. It’s a tool.</p>
